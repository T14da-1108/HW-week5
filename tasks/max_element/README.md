## Max element

`numpy`

### Task

Implement a function which accepts one-dimensional array `X` and returns the biggest element
among those which are preceded by zero.

If there are no such elements, return `None`.

For example, assuming ```X = np.array([6, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 7, 0])``` the answer would be 5,
as there are three elements preceded by zero: 3, 0 and 5.

### Notes

* You cannot use loops (keywords *for* and *while*) as well as list comprehension, *map*, etc.
