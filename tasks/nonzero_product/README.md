## Nonzero Product

`numpy`

### Task
Implement a function which calculates the product of non-zero values on the main matrix diagonal. 

For instance, with input ```X = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [2, 0, 2], [3, 0, 3], [4, 4, 4]])``` your function
should return 3, as the diagonal is `[1, 0, 3]`.
If all elements are zeroes, return ```None```.

### Notes

* You cannot use loops (keywords *for* and *while*) as well as list comprehension, *map*, etc.
* As in “Introduction to NumPy”, here *matrix* means a two-dimensional NumPy array.
