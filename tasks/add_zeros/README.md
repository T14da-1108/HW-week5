## Add zeros

`numpy`

### Task
Implement a function which accepts vector ```x``` and returns the same vector but with zeros inserted 
between every two numbers.

Example:

```
[1, -5, 3]      ->      [1, 0, -5, 0, 3]
```

For more examples, you can try and read `test_public.py`.

### Notes

* You cannot use loops (keywords *for* and *while*) as well as list comprehension, *map*, etc.
